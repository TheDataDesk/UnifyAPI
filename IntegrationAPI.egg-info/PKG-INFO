# IntegrationAPI

IntegrationAPI is a Python package that simplifies the integration of multiple APIs, including social media, payment gateways, and geolocation services. With this package, you can seamlessly connect to various APIs and streamline your application's functionality.

## Features

- **Social Media Integration:** Easily connect to popular social media platforms like Twitter

- **Payment Handling:** Simplify online transactions with support for payment gateways like PayPal.

- **Geolocation Services:** Access geolocation data and integrate maps using the power of Google Maps.

- **User-Friendly:** Provides a straightforward and consistent interface for working with multiple APIs.

## Installation

To install the IntegrationAPI package, use `pip`:

```bash
pip install integrationapi
```

## Usage
Here's how you can use the IntegrationAPI package in your Python project:
```bash
from integrationapi.social_media import TwitterAPI
```

## Replace with your Twitter API credentials

api_key = "your_api_key"
api_secret = "your_api_secret"
access_token = "your_access_token"
access_token_secret = "your_access_token_secret"

## Create an instance of the TwitterAPI class
twitter_client = TwitterAPI(api_key, api_secret, access_token, access_token_secret)

## Use the class to fetch user tweets
username = "some_twitter_user"
tweets = twitter_client.get_user_tweets(username)

for tweet in tweets:
    print(tweet)

# Limitations 

In the initial release, version 1.0, we have successfully integrated essential APIs, namely Twitter, PayPal, and Google Maps. This strategic selection of APIs empowers our application with social media engagement, secure payment processing, and geolocation services. These integrations enable us to provide a comprehensive user experience by incorporating functionalities from these prominent service providers. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that, in this version, our system is designed with a specific constraint in mind, limiting our API portfolio. Future releases are planned to expand the scope and capabilities by incorporating additional APIs to diversify the range of features and services we can offer to our users. This iterative approach aligns with our commitment to delivering a robust and versatile software solution by harnessing the power of various APIs as we continue to evolve and meet the evolving demands of our user base.
